Here are the detailed rules for the “Who Am I?” game:

1. **Objective**: 
   - The goal is for each player (or the chatbot user) to figure out the identity assigned to them. This identity can be a famous person, fictional character, or any well-known figure.

2. **Setup**:
   - The chatbot secretly chooses a name or character and assigns it to the guessing player.
   - The guessing player does not know their assigned identity at the start of the game.

3. **Asking Questions**:
   - The guessing player can ask only *yes/no* questions about their assigned identity.
   - Example questions: “Am I a real person?”, “Am I alive?”, “Am I fictional?”, “Am I known for sports?”, etc.

4. **Answering Questions**:
   - Whoever knows the identity (in this case, the chatbot) answers each yes/no question truthfully: “Yes,” “No,” or occasionally “I’m not sure” if it’s not clearly defined.

5. **Guessing**:
   - At any point, the guessing player can try to guess their identity.
   - If they guess correctly, they win! If not, they can continue asking questions until they figure it out.
