Here are the detailed rules for the “Fantasia Genesis” game:

## Objective
- Immerse yourself in the fantastical setting generated by the chatbot.  
- Uncover the mysteries of the world, complete quests, and forge your own path through story-driven interactions.

## Setup
**World Creation**  
   - The chatbot (as GM) describes the initial setting: the environment, current situation, and relevant NPCs (non-player characters).
   - This can be any genre or mix (High Fantasy, Futuristic, Post-Apocalyptic, etc.), chosen or randomized by the chatbot.
**Main Character**  
   - The chatbot provides you with a main character, including basic backstory, attributes (e.g., strength, agility, intelligence), and any unique traits.
   - You have an **Inventory** of items or equipment that you start with (e.g., a sword, healing potions, a lockpick set, etc.).
**Narrative Prompt**  
   - The chatbot sets up an initial conflict or objective (e.g., rescue a village, retrieve a lost artifact, explore a haunted forest).
   - You, as the player, choose how to proceed.

## Player Actions**
In **Fantasia Genesis**, you mainly have **two** categories of actions:
*Think**  
   - When you choose to “think,” you are effectively asking the chatbot (GM) for:
     - What your character remembers or knows about a topic (e.g., local lore, NPC relationships).
     - Current status information (e.g., health points, magic points, quest progress).
     - Observations or details about your surroundings (e.g., hidden clues, relevant descriptions).
   - **Example**:  
     - *Player*: “I think about the properties of the healing herb in my inventory.”  
     - *Chatbot (GM)*: “You recall that the healing herb can restore a small amount of health if brewed into a tea.”
**Do** (Using Your Inventory or Taking Action)
   - When you “do” something, you attempt an action within the game world.  
   - This may include:
     - **Using** an item from your inventory (e.g., “Use healing potion,” “Light a torch,” “Equip sword”).
     - **Interacting** with the environment (e.g., “Search the chest,” “Climb the tower,” “Talk to the guard”).
     - **Performing** skill-based tasks (e.g., “Cast a spell,” “Attempt to pick a lock,” “Stealthily move past guards”).
   - **Example**:  
     - *Player*: “I do: Use my rope to climb down the cliff.”  
     - *Chatbot (GM)*: “You secure the rope and carefully descend. The rocks are slippery, so make a Dexterity check!”

## Game Master (Chatbot) Role**
- **World Description**: The chatbot narrates the setting, NPC behaviors, and consequences of your actions.  
- **Story Progression**: Based on your “think” or “do” actions, the chatbot updates the story: describing outcomes, awarding new items, or revealing plot points.  
- **Decision Outcomes**: The chatbot may ask you to clarify your approach or roll a virtual dice if there is an element of chance (if desired).  

## Inventory Management**
- The chatbot tracks the items you have and their statuses (e.g., used, broken, consumed).  
- You can “think” about your inventory to recall what you are carrying, or “do” to use an item.  
- Example inventory items might be:
  - **Weapons**: Swords, bows, spell wands.  
  - **Tools**: Ropes, lockpicks, lanterns.  
  - **Consumables**: Healing potions, herbs, rations.

## Progress & Challenges**
- **Story Arcs**: You may receive quests or objectives. Completing them advances the story and potentially unlocks new areas or abilities.  
- **Encounters**: You might come across enemies or dangerous situations. Handle these by using your inventory, making strategic “do” actions, or acquiring clues through “think” actions.

## Tips & Best Practices**
1. **Stay Curious**: Use “think” to uncover clues or recall important details.  
2. **Be Creative**: Try various “do” actions to solve puzzles, avoid danger, or interact with NPCs.  
3. **Collaborate**: If the chatbot introduces NPC allies, engage with them for help or new items.  
4. **Track Key Info**: Keep notes on major quests, items, or knowledge gained.
