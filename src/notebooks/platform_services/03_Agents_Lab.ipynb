    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll explore the concept of **LLM Agents** within the LLM Agentic Tool Mesh platform. LLM Agentic Tool Mesh provides all the necessary tools to build a powerful agentic system by handling:\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the concept of LLM Agents and how they operate within LLM Agentic Tool Mesh.\n",
    "- Learn the differences between the Star and Snowflake architectures for coordinating multi-agent systems.\n",
    "- Define and manage tasks for multiple agents using LLM Agentic Tool Mesh's Agent Service."

    "## Definition of LLM Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of LLM, an **agent** is an autonomous entity capable of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Perceiving its environment**: Agents can gather and interpret information from their surroundings.\n",
    "- **Making decisions**: Based on the information perceived, agents can decide on the best course of action.\n",
    "- **Acting on decisions**: Agents execute actions that help achieve specific objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "These agents can operate independently or interact with one another to optimize their collective performance, depending on the complexity of the task."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### What is Multi-Agent AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Agent AI** involves coordinating multiple agents, each specialized in a specific domain or function, to collaborate and achieve a common goal. These agents can handle:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task Division**: Agents can divide a complex task into smaller, manageable parts.\n",
    "- **Specialization**: Each agent may specialize in a particular function, such as information retrieval, summarization, or decision-making.\n",
    "- **Collaboration**: Agents can communicate and share information, enabling more effective and efficient task execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing such agents typically requires advanced coding and deep knowledge of agent-based systems. However, **LLM Agentic Tool Mesh simplifies** this process by providing high-level abstraction through intuitive prompts and configuration files. This allows users to focus on defining tasks and desired outcomes, while LLM Agentic Tool Mesh handles the coordination, task distribution, and result aggregation behind the scenes."

    "## Architecture Options for LLM Agents in LLM Agentic Tool Mesh\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM Agentic Tool Mesh offers two primary architectural models for managing LLM Agents: the **Star Architecture** and the **Snowflake Architecture**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Star** architecture, a central Reasoning Engine powered by an LLM orchestrates various tools. This setup enables a single chatbot agent to manage and execute tasks using a suite of individual tools, providing centralized control and streamlined management.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Snowflake** architecture expands on the Star model by introducing multiple LLM-equipped agents. These agents collaborate, sharing resources and tasks, which enhances the system's ability to handle complex operations. This distributed approach significantly improves performance through cooperative task execution.\n",

    "## Tool Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents in LLM Agentic Tool Mesh rely on **tools** to perform specialized tasks such as information retrieval, document summarization, or data analysis. These tools act as extensions to the agents' capabilities, allowing them to efficiently complete complex operations. The effectiveness of the system is greatly enhanced by how well these tools are organized and accessed, making **tool management** a critical aspect of working with multi-agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tool Repository** service in LLM Agentic Tool Mesh is designed to simplify and automate the storage, management, and retrieval of tools. This service leverages the concepts we explored earlier to ensure that agents have seamless access to a wide range of tools, along with their associated metadata, to execute tasks effectively and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Tool Storage**:\n",
    "   - Allows for adding tools with associated metadata, including tool name, description, function, and usage parameters.\n",
    "   - Supports a variety of tool types, from pre-built utilities to custom implementations tailored for specific agent tasks.\n",
    "   - Ensures that tools are organized and readily available for use by multiple agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tool Retrieval Based on Criteria**:\n",
    "   - Provides flexible search and retrieval functionality, enabling agents to access tools based on specific criteria such as task requirements, tool type, or metadata attributes.\n",
    "   - Ensures that the right tools are selected for the right tasks, optimizing the performance of the multi-agent system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Metadata Management**:\n",
    "   - Stores relevant metadata for each tool, including versioning, author information, last usage, and specific capabilities.\n",
    "   - Metadata can be queried and used to decide which tools are best suited for certain tasks or environments."

The bid is the highest amount that a buyer is currently willing to pay, whereas the ask is the lowest amount that a seller is currently willing to sell. The numbers next to the bid/ask are the “ size ”. The bid size displays the total amount of desired shares\n",

      "The  bid-ask spread  can indicate a stock’s liquidity, which is how easy it is to buy and sell in the marketplace. Often, a smaller spread suggests higher liquidity, meaning more buyers and sellers in the market are willing to negotiate. In contrast, a larger spread suggests lower liquidity, as there are fewer investors willing to negotiate. You can use the bid-ask spread to determine whether to place a  market order  or  limit order  when trading, helping you to optimize your price and have a successful order execution.\n",

      "To develop trading strategies for TSLA with a medium risk tolerance and day trading preferences, consider the following approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Trend Following Strategy**: Given the upward trend identified by ARIMA models, utilize a trend-following strategy. This involves entering trades in the direction of the prevailing trend. Use moving averages (e.g., 20-day or 50-day) to confirm the trend direction. When the stock price is above the moving average, consider long positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Momentum Trading**: Capitalize on TSLA's momentum by identifying entry points when the stock shows strong price movement. Use indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to gauge momentum. Enter trades when RSI is above 50 or when MACD line crosses above the signal line.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Volatility-Based Strategy**: Due to high volatility, incorporate strategies like Bollinger Bands to identify potential entry and exit points. When the stock price breaks above or below the bands, it may indicate a significant move. Consider entering trades in the direction of the breakout.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Risk Management with Stop-Loss Orders**: Implement stop-loss orders to mitigate risks associated with high volatility. Set stop-loss levels at key support or resistance levels to limit potential losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Hedging with Options**: Use options to hedge against potential downside risks. Consider strategies like protective puts, where you buy put options to protect against declines while holding the stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Diversification**: Diversify your day trading portfolio across different sectors or stocks to spread risk. Do not allocate all capital to TSLA, as market corrections can lead to significant losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "By combining these strategies, a trader can leverage TSLA's upward trend while managing risks associated with volatility and potential market corrections. Always backtest strategies and adjust based on market conditions.\u001b[00m\n",

      "2. **Momentum Trading**: Capitalize on TSLA's momentum by identifying opportune entry points when the stock demonstrates robust price movement. Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) can be useful tools to gauge momentum. Positions may be opened when the RSI crosses above the 50 mark or when the MACD line surpasses the signal line.\n",

      "3. **Volatility-Based Strategy**: Given the high volatility, you can integrate strategies that focus on volatility indicators like Bollinger Bands. Significant moves may be anticipated when the stock price breaks beyond the bands, suggesting potential entry in the direction of the price breakout.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Risk Management with Stop-Loss Orders**: To handle risks brought on by volatility, employ stop-loss orders strategically. These should be placed at critical support or resistance points to curtail potential losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Hedging with Options**: Consider employing options to safeguard against downside risks. Protective puts, where put options are bought to guard against dropping prices while holding the stock, are an effective method for hedging.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Diversification**: It's crucial to diversify the day trading portfolio across various sectors or stocks to mitigate risk. By not committing all capital to TSLA, the strategy seeks to buffer against losses that may result from market corrections.\n",

      "\n",

The forecast, building on a target for \"slight growth\" in deliveries this year, pushed the company's shares up 12% in post-market trading on Wednesday. This set up Tesla to add about $80 billion in stock market value. A drop in the cost of making vehicles added comfort for investors who saw Musk focusing on boosting Tesla's industry-leading margin, even as he talked about a future dominated by autonomous cars. Tesla's long-awaited unveiling of its robotaxi on Oct. 10 failed to impress investors. \"No EV company is even profitable,\" Musk told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday. \"And to the best of my knowledge, there was no EV division of any company, of any existing auto company that is profitable. So it is notable that Tesla is profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment.\" Shares of Tesla's smaller EV rivals Rivian (RIVN.O) , opens new tab and Lucid (LCID.O) , opens new tab both rose 2% after-hours. Musk said Tesla would roll out driverless vehicles offering paid rides next year, after the company received regulatory approval in California and Texas. He said adoption - and sales - of the company's supervised autopilot software, known as Full Self-Driving, increased substantially after the robotaxi event. Tesla this month again offered FSD free for a month to its current customers, for the second time this year. The company said in a statement earlier it remained focused on expanding its vehicle lineup, cutting costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity, despite uncertain demand and rivals pulling back on EV investments. \"Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025,\" it said.

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Tesla's third-quarter profit margin from vehicle sales, excluding regulatory credits, grew to 17.05% from 14.6% in the prior three-month period, according to Reuters calculations. Wall Street had expected 14.9%, according to 24 analysts polled by Visible Alpha. But Tesla's finance boss, Vaibhav Taneja, said it would be \"challenging\" to sustain these margins in the fourth quarter ending December. The EV giant said that the labor and material costs of making vehicles, known as the cost of goods sold per vehicle, dropped to its lowest-ever level, about $35,100. Adjusted profit of 72 cents per share in the third quarter beat an average estimate of 58 cents. Prices of raw materials used to make EV batteries have been falling and Tesla has said its costs will decline as a result this year, with the effect diminishing over time. Taneja forecast more than $11 billion in capital expenses for next year. \"The improving numbers across the board signal the company may have finally found a nice sweet spot for the pricing-versus-production-costs equation,\" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. \"The report also diminishes the urgency for a cheaper model.\" INCENTIVES After slashing prices last year, Tesla started offering lucrative financing options this spring to boost demand. It has already delivered 1.29 million vehicles in the first nine months of this year. It needs to hand over another 514,925 vehicles to beat last year's record. \"The fear going into results was that the huge incentives effort to push volumes into the tough EV market would materially dent margins – that doesn’t look the be the case,\" said Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown who also personally owns Tesla shares. Revenue for the July-September quarter was $25.18 billion, compared with estimates of $25.37 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. It reported sales of $23.35 billion in the corresponding quarter of 2023. Tesla said it recognized its second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenue. This metric was up 33% year-over-year to $739 million, but down from $890 million in the second quarter. Sign up here. Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Abhirup Roy in San Francisco;\n",

Momentum Trading: With a significant increase in TSLA's price, momentum indicators such as RSI or MACD should be monitored for position openings. 3. Volatility-Based Strategy: Bollinger Bands are used to anticipate significant moves due to current volatility. 4. Risk Management with Stop-Loss Orders: Stop-loss orders are placed at critical support levels, potentially near $457.51. 5. Hedging with Options: Protect against downside risk with protective puts, given TSLA's high beta (2.30). 6. Diversification: Ensure portfolio diversification to mitigate risks, potentially using ETFs that include TSLA.
