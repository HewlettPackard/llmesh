MCP Host Service

This service provides Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for the LLM Agentic Tool Mesh platform.

Key Features:
- Centralized MCP server registry and management
- Integration with platform agent services (reasoning engines, tool repositories, task forces)
- Capability discovery and caching across multiple MCP servers
- Tool search and discovery across the MCP ecosystem
