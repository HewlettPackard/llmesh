    "# Lab: Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized approach for communication between AI-powered applications, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). This is to facilitate easier integrations between various frameworks, applications, and model services as they continue to grow in scale/complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP is designed to define a clear structure for managing LLM **prompts**, contextual information (which can include references to **tools** and **resources**), and data exchange when an application (a client) communicates with a model service (a server). This is not the complete specification of the protocol, but a simplified overview to illustrate the key concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key objectives and potential benefits of using a protocol like MCP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved Interoperability**: Facilitating connections between applications and a variety of model backends.\n",
    "* **Standardized Patterns**: Promoting common communication methods for leveraging **prompts**, requesting **tool** executions, and receiving model-generated content.\n",
    "* **Rich Context & Instruction Handling**: Providing defined ways to pass not just conversational history, but also detailed **prompts**, and specifications for how models should use available **tools** or access **resources**.\n",
    "* **Extensibility**: Allowing for future enhancements or specialized data exchanges within the protocol's framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP interactions use a client-server architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"left\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"pictures/mcp-arch.png\" alt=\"MCP Architecture\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Client**: The component within a host application (such as an LLM-powered app or IDE) that communicates with the MCP server. The client forms and sends requests (such as tool invocations, resource lookups, or prompt template requests) to the server and processes the responses. The client typically acts on behalf of the application's AI model, enabling it to access external tools and resources via the MCP protocol.\n",
    "2.  **Server**: A service that exposes tools, resources, and prompt templates via MCP. It listens for client requests, manages tool execution or resource access as defined by the protocol, and returns structured responses. The MCP server does not typically host or run AI models itself; instead, it provides external capabilities that can be used by models running in the client’s host application.\n",
    "3.  **Transport Layer**: The underlying mechanism for message transmission. MCP defines the structure and interaction flow, with flexibility in transport mechanisms. MCP supports:\n",
    "    * Standard Input/Output (STDIO)\n",
    "    * Streamable HTTP (with optional Server-Sent Events)\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation allows flexibility in choosing a transport suitable for the application's environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The protocol itself does not define this but MCP Hosts are discrete components actually implementing the protocol. A MCP Host is the entity that includes server(s) and/or client(s) and can be implemented in any programming language. Servers and client connections can/often-are maintained within the same MCP host.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Components\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP interactions involve several key elements and types of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Messages**: Defined units of information exchanged between client and server using JSON-RPC format. Common patterns include:\n",
    "    * Request messages from client to server\n",
    "    * Response messages from server to client\n",
    "    * Notification messages that don't require responses\n",
    "    * Error messages for communicating issues\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Prompts**: The core input that guides the model's behavior. MCP facilitates powerful prompt management.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Tools & Resources**: Mechanisms by which a model can interact with external systems or data:\n",
    "    * **Tools**: Pre-defined functions or capabilities that the model can be instructed to use (e.g., calculators, search engines, database query functions)\n",
    "    * **Resources**: External data sources or knowledge bases that the model might need to access to fulfill a request\n",
    "    * *Note: The specifics of how tools and resources are defined and invoked can vary*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Protocol (Interaction Flow)\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical interaction sequence in MCP includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Connection**: The client connects to the MCP server via the chosen transport mechanism.\n",
    "2.  **Initialization**: Client and server exchange initialization messages to establish capabilities and protocol version.\n",
    "3.  **Request**: The client sends a request message with the **prompt**, relevant context, parameters, and any **tool** or **resource** specifications.\n",
    "4.  **Processing**: The server processes the request, which may involve:\n",
    "    * Interpreting the prompt\n",
    "    * Invoking tools as specified\n",
    "    * Accessing resources as needed\n",
    "    * Generating model responses\n",
    "5.  **Response**: The server returns the response, either as a complete message or (if using Streamable HTTP) potentially as a stream of partial responses.\n",
    "6.  **Error Handling**: If issues arise, appropriate error messages are exchanged.\n",
    "7.  **Disconnection**: The connection may be closed or kept alive for subsequent interactions, depending on the transport and use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach helps create more predictable and maintainable integrations with AI models, encompassing complex interactions involving prompts, tools, and resources while maintaining flexibility in implementation details."

    "## STDIO Transport\n",
    "\n",
    "The STDIO (Standard Input/Output) transport is the primary MCP implementation that clients should support. It uses standard input and output streams to exchange MCP messages between client and server processes.\n",

    "   - The server reads JSON-RPC messages from its standard input (stdin)\n",
    "   - The server sends messages to its standard output (stdout)\n",
    "   - Messages are delimited by newlines and MUST NOT contain embedded newlines\n",
    "3. **Message Types**: Messages may be JSON-RPC requests, notifications, responses, or batched messages containing multiple requests/notifications\n",
    "4. **Logging**: The server MAY write UTF-8 strings to its standard error (stderr) for logging purposes, which clients MAY capture, forward, or ignore"

    "## SSE Transport (Deprecated)\n",
    "\n",
    "Server-Sent Events (SSE) was originally used in MCP as part of the \"HTTP+SSE transport\" protocol, which has since been deprecated and replaced by the Streamable HTTP transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note\n",
    "\n",
    "- The standalone \"HTTP+SSE transport\" from protocol version 2024-11-05 has been **deprecated**\n",
    "- SSE functionality has been **absorbed into** the new Streamable HTTP transport (as of protocol version 2025-03-26)\n",
    "- The Python SDK currently only supports SSE transport\n",
    "- This section covers the SSE implementation as used in current Python MCP implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Server-to-Client Streaming**: Enables servers to push updates to clients over HTTP\n",
    "- **Event-Based Communication**: Uses SSE event format with `event`, `data`, and `id` fields\n",
    "- **HTTP-Compatible**: Works over standard HTTP connections\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Client establishes an HTTP connection requesting SSE stream\n",
    "2. Server sends initial `endpoint` event with connection details\n",
    "3. Server streams JSON-RPC messages as SSE events\n",
    "4. Client processes messages as they arrive"

    "## Streamable HTTP Transport\n",
    "\n",
    "The Streamable HTTP transport is the current standard MCP transport mechanism, replacing the deprecated HTTP+SSE transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Current Standard**: The recommended transport mechanism for MCP\n",
    "- **HTTP-Based**: Uses standard HTTP POST and GET requests\n",
    "- **Optional Streaming**: Server can optionally use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses\n",
    "- **Stateless or Stateful**: Supports both basic stateless servers and more feature-rich servers with sessions\n",
    "- **Multiple Connections**: Clients can maintain multiple concurrent connections\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Endpoint**: Server provides one HTTP endpoint that supports both POST and GET methods\n",
    "2. **Sending Messages**: \n",
    "   - Client sends JSON-RPC messages via HTTP POST to the MCP endpoint\n",
    "   - Client must include `Accept` header with both `application/json` and `text/event-stream`\n",
    "3. **Server Response Options**:\n",
    "   - **Simple Response**: Return `Content-Type: application/json` with a single JSON object\n",
    "   - **Streaming Response**: Return `Content-Type: text/event-stream` to initiate SSE streaming\n",
    "4. **Receiving Messages**: \n",
    "   - Client can issue HTTP GET to open SSE streams for server-initiated messages\n",
    "   - Server may send JSON-RPC requests and notifications via SSE\n",
    "5. **Session Management**: Server may optionally assign session IDs for stateful interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The MCP Inspector (shown below) provides a TypeScript client for testing Streamable HTTP connections.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you've learned about the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its various transport mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **STDIO Transport**: Direct subprocess communication for local MCP servers\n",
    "2. **SSE Transport** (Deprecated): Server-Sent Events for streaming responses\n",
    "3. **Streamable HTTP Transport**: The current standard with optional SSE streaming\n",
    "4. **OAuth Authentication**: Securing MCP servers with Auth0 and OAuth 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- MCP provides a standardized way for AI applications to communicate\n",
    "- The Python SDK now includes built-in support for streamable HTTP clients\n",
    "- OAuth authentication can be easily integrated for production deployments\n",
    "- The protocol supports tools, resources, and prompts as core primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore creating your own MCP tools and resources\n",
    "- Implement real Auth0 authentication for production use\n",
    "- Build MCP clients that integrate with your AI applications\n",
    "- Contribute to the MCP ecosystem with new server implementations\n",

    "## OAuth Authentication with Auth0\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python MCP SDK supports OAuth 2.0 authentication, allowing you to secure your MCP servers with industry-standard authentication. This section demonstrates how to implement Auth0 authentication for MCP servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab section requires additional dependencies:\n",
    "- **PyJWT**: For JWT token verification (`pip install PyJWT`)\n",
    "- **aiohttp**: For the callback server (`pip install aiohttp`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: The authentication implementation in this lab is now fully functional with real JWT verification, callback server, and token refresh capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OAuth 2.0 with PKCE**: Secure authorization code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange\n",
    "- **Real JWT Verification**: Server-side validation of JWT tokens using PyJWT and Auth0's JWKS\n",
    "- **Automatic Callback Handling**: Built-in callback server for authorization code exchange\n",
    "- **Token Refresh**: Automatic token refresh when tokens approach expiration\n",
    "- **Scoped Access**: Fine-grained permissions using OAuth scopes\n",
    "- **RFC 9728 Compliance**: Implements OAuth discovery endpoints for standardized authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Server Configuration**: The MCP server is configured with an Auth0 token verifier that:\n",
    "   - Fetches JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) from Auth0\n",
    "   - Validates JWT signatures using RS256 algorithm\n",
    "   - Verifies token claims (audience, issuer, expiration)\n",
    "   - Extracts scopes and user information\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Client Authentication**: \n",
    "   - Client starts a local callback server (auto-finds available port)\n",
    "   - Opens Auth0 login in browser with PKCE parameters\n",
    "   - User authenticates and authorizes the application\n",
    "   - Auth0 redirects to local callback server\n",
    "   - Client automatically exchanges authorization code for tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Token Management**:\n",
    "   - Tokens are stored in memory (production should use secure storage)\n",
    "   - Client monitors token expiration\n",
    "   - Automatically refreshes tokens before expiration\n",
    "   - Handles refresh token rotation if configured in Auth0\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Authorized Access**: Client can now call protected MCP tools with valid tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up Auth0\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Auth0 authentication in production:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an Auth0 account at https://auth0.com\n",
    "2. Create a new Application (type: \"Single Page Application\")\n",
    "3. Configure allowed callback URLs: `http://localhost:8080/callback` (and other ports if needed)\n",
    "4. Set up an API in Auth0 with appropriate scopes\n",
    "5. Configure environment variables:\n",
    "   - `AUTH0_DOMAIN`: Your Auth0 domain (e.g., `dev-example.auth0.com`)\n",
    "   - `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`: API identifier from Auth0\n",
    "   - `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`: Your Auth0 application's Client ID\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This demo uses example Auth0 credentials. For production use, you must:\n",
    "- Replace with your own Auth0 configuration\n",
    "- Ensure your Auth0 application is properly configured\n",
    "- Add appropriate scopes and permissions\n",
    "- Implement secure token storage (not in-memory)"
