    "# Generating an LLM Agent Routine Using Meta-Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook utilizes **meta-prompting techniques** to generate a structured **system prompt**, providing the LLM Agent with a clear **operational blueprint**. This ensures the agent functions as an **autonomous, policy-compliant assistant**, capable of making informed decisions within its designated domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Policy Document (Operational Manual)** – A structured set of operational procedures, rules, and best practices followed by human operators. This defines the expected standards for decision-making and compliance.\n",
    "2. **Available Tools List** – A catalog of external tools the LLM Agent can utilize to interact with various systems, including APIs, databases, and automation services. Each tool has specific capabilities, inputs, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By synthesizing these inputs, we will construct a **system prompt** that defines a structured **routine** for the LLM Agent to follow. This routine will:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensure compliance with operational policies**, maintaining consistency and adherence to best practices.  \n",
    "- **Optimize tool usage**, leveraging available functionalities efficiently while respecting their constraints.  \n",
    "- **Implement a structured reasoning framework**, enabling the agent to process information, make decisions, and execute tasks in a logical and context-aware manner.  \n",
