    "# Evaluating an LLM Agent Routine Using Meta-Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook systematically **evaluates** an LLM Agent routine using a **test-driven approach**. By simulating real-world interactions between a **user and the agent**, we measure the agent's effectiveness in following its structured **system prompt** and making accurate decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the agent’s **compliance, reasoning, and accuracy**, we define a controlled testing environment where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test Cases (CSV Input)** – A dataset containing multiple test scenarios, each with:\n",
    "   - **Context**: The operational background or situation.\n",
    "   - **User Request**: The problem or inquiry initiated by the user.\n",
    "   - **Expected Function**: The correct function the agent should invoke.\n",
    "   - **Expected Inputs**: The required parameters for proper execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dual LLM Simulation**\n",
    "   - **User Simulator**: A simulated user that provides inputs dynamically from the test case.\n",
    "   - **Agent Simulator**: The LLM agent utilizing the **structured routine** from the meta-prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conversational Interaction**\n",
    "   - The **User Simulator** presents queries based on the test case.\n",
    "   - The **Agent Simulator** processes requests and responds according to its defined **meta-prompt routine**.\n",
    "   - A simulated **dialogue** unfolds, mimicking a real-world exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation Metrics**\n",
    "   - We verify whether the **Agent Simulator** correctly identifies and executes the **Expected Function**.\n",
    "   - We check if the function was called with the **correct inputs**.\n",
    "   - **Accuracy Score** is computed based on passed and failed tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assess the Agent’s Compliance** with structured reasoning and policy adherence.\n",
    "- **Measure Execution Accuracy** by comparing function calls against expected outputs.\n",
    "- **Identify System Strengths & Weaknesses** for further refinements.\n",
