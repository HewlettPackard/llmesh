    "### 1. Policy Document\n",
    "This file contains the structured operational guidelines that define the expected behavior of the AI agent. To adapt the agent to your use case, update the policy document located at:\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Test Cases\n",
    "The test case file serves as the foundation for evaluating the agentâ€™s performance. This file must contain structured test cases with the following required columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Column Name**        | **Description**                                            |\n",

    "| **Request**            | The specific user query the agent must process.          |\n",
    "| **Expected Function**  | The function the agent should invoke.                     |\n",
    "| **Expected Inputs**    | JSON object defining the functionâ€™s required inputs.     |\n",
    "| **Tool Input Columns** | Additional columns based on tool parameters (e.g., `Order ID`, `Reason`, `Refund Amount`, `Customer ID`). |\n",
