    "\n",
    "To train your AI agent effectively, you need to update the **input files**. The key files that require customization are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Policy Document**\n",
    "This file contains the structured operational guidelines that define the expected behavior of the AI agent. To adapt the agent to your use case, update the policy document located at:\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“‚ `input/ecommerce_customer_service.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Test Cases**\n",
    "The test case file serves as the foundation for evaluating the agentâ€™s performance. This file must contain structured test cases with the following required columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Column Name**        | **Description**                                            |\n",
    "|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Context**            | High-level user intent for the request.                   |\n",
    "| **Request**            | The specific user query the agent must process.          |\n",
    "| **Expected Function**  | The function the agent should invoke.                     |\n",
    "| **Expected Inputs**    | JSON object defining the functionâ€™s required inputs.     |\n",
    "| **Tool Input Columns** | Additional columns based on tool parameters (e.g., `Order ID`, `Reason`, `Refund Amount`, `Customer ID`). |\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "## **Setting Up the Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the agent to function properly, you need tool definitions. Each function used by the agent must have an associated **tool file**, structured like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Defining the Tools in `config.yaml`**\n",

    "### **Choosing the Right LLM for Meta-Prompting**\n",
    "It is important to use an LLM with strong **reasoning capabilities** to effectively perform meta-prompting. Depending on the LLM you are using, you may need to customize the **system prompts** in `config.yaml`. For example, **Claude** works better when system prompts are structured in **XML format**, while other models like GPT-4o might perform best with JSON or natural language-based prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that the `config.yaml` file is properly set up to integrate your tools and training data. Below is an example of the correct configuration:\n",
    "\n",

    "prompts:\n",
    "  type: JinjaTemplate\n",
    "  environment: notebooks/meta_prompting/prompts/\n",
    "  templates:\n",
    "    customer_persona: customer_persona.txt\n",
    "    agent_persona: agent_persona.txt\n",
    "    routine_generation: routine_generation.txt\n",
    "    routine_improvement: routine_improvement.txt\n",
    "    evals_history: evals_history.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using **Claude**, you might want to modify these prompts to use XML:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "prompts:\n",
    "  type: JinjaTemplate\n",
    "  environment: notebooks/meta_prompting/prompts/\n",
    "  templates:\n",
    "    routine_generation: routine_generation.xml\n",
    "    routine_improvement: routine_improvement.xml\n",

    "## **Final Thoughts**\n",
    "By following these steps, you can **train, deploy, and fine-tune your AI agent** for real-world e-commerce customer service scenarios. If you need to expand its capabilities, simply:\n",
    "- **Update the policy document** to define new rules.\n",
    "- **Add test cases** to train the agent on different queries.\n",
    "- **Ensure your tools are properly defined** and listed in `config.yaml`.\n",
    "- **Customize the system prompts** in `config.yaml` to optimize performance for different LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach ensures your AI agent remains **efficient, scalable, and adaptable** for evolving business needs. ðŸš€\n",
