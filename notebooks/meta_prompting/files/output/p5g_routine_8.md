Improved Routine Instructions:

1. Identify Customer Request Type:
   - Scan the customer's query for keywords and determine the category from the following list:
     a. Monitor network performance (keywords: latency, bandwidth, signal_strength, throughput) → Proceed to Step 2.
     b. Retrieve AMF‐NGAP status (keywords: AMF, NGAP, interface status) → Proceed to Step 3.
     c. Request network function logs (keywords: logs, retrieve logs) → Proceed to Step 4.
     d. Read a network function profile (keywords: profile, network function profile) → Proceed to Step 5.
     e. Obtain the list of authorized users/devices/UEs (keywords: authorized users, devices, imsi-) → Proceed to Step 6.
     f. Retrieve information for a specific user/device/UE (keywords: details, information, specific user) → Proceed to Step 7.
     g. Retrieve the list of approved data profiles (keywords: data profiles, approved profiles) → Proceed to Step 8.
     h. Retrieve details for a specific data profile (keywords: data profile details, uuid) → Proceed to Step 9.
     i. Assign a new data profile to a user (keywords: assign, set, allocate, data profile) → Proceed to Step 10.
     j. Retrieve UE location information (keywords: location, UE location, pdu session) → Proceed to Step 11.
     k. If the request is ambiguous or does not clearly match any of the categories above, ask the customer for clarification. If necessary, escalate the request.

2. Monitor Network Performance:
   - Prompt: "Please provide the network function name (in lower-case) and the specific KPI metric you want to track (choose from: latency, bandwidth, signal_strength, throughput)."
   - Ensure that the network function name is normalized to lower-case.
   - Validate that the metric is one of: 'latency', 'bandwidth', or 'signal_strength'. If the customer specifies 'throughput', automatically convert it to 'bandwidth'.
   - Call the get_network_performance function with parameters: nf and metric.

3. Retrieve AMF‐NGAP Status:
   - Prompt: "Please provide the network function name (in lower-case) from which you want to retrieve the AMF‐NGAP status (e.g., 'amf')."
   - Normalize the network function name to lower-case.
   - Call the get_amf_ngap_status function with parameter: nf.

4. Retrieve Logs from a Network Function:
   - Prompt: "Please specify the network function name (in lower-case, e.g., 'ausf', 'udm') for which you require logs."
   - Normalize the network function name to lower-case.
   - Call the get_logs function with parameter: nf.

5. Read Network Function Profile:
   - Prompt: "Please provide the controlling network function name (typically 'nrf') and the target network function name whose profile you want to retrieve (e.g., 'amf', 'udm', 'smf'). Both names must be provided in lower-case."
   - Normalize both names to lower-case.
   - Call the get_nf_profile function with parameters: nf (controlling function) and target_nf (target function).

6. Retrieve the List of Authorized Users/Devices/UEs:
   - Prompt: "Please confirm if you want to retrieve the list of all authorized devices/users (IDs starting with 'imsi-') from the HPE 5G Core."
   - Use a default lower-case network function name (e.g., 'udm').
   - Call the get_supis function with parameter: nf.

7. Retrieve Information for a Specific User/Device/UE:
   - Prompt: "Please provide the identifier of the specific user/device/UE. Ensure that the provided ID starts with 'imsi-'. If it does not, please verify against the approved device list and provide the correct identifier."
   - Normalize the network function name (e.g., 'udm') to lower-case.
   - If the identifier is valid, call the get_supi function with parameters: nf and supi.

8. Retrieve the List of Authorized Data Profiles:
   - Prompt: "Please provide the network function name (in lower-case, e.g., 'udr') used to retrieve the list of authorized data profiles."
   - Normalize the network function name to lower-case.
   - Call the get_dataprofiles function with parameter: nf.

9. Retrieve Specific Data Profile Information:
   - Prompt: "Please provide the UUID for the data profile you want to retrieve."
   - Ensure that the network function name (e.g., 'udr') is in lower-case.
   - Call the get_dataprofile function with parameters: nf and uuid.

10. Assign a New User Data Profile:
    - Prompt: "Please provide the network function name (in lower-case), the user's identifier (must start with 'imsi-' or correctly match an entry from the approved device list), and the data profile UUID from the approved list."
    - If the user identifier does not start with 'imsi-', ask: "Can you confirm the identifier or provide additional details to locate the device in the approved list?"
    - If the data profile UUID is missing or not recognized, ask: "The provided data profile UUID is not recognized. Can you please verify or provide additional details?"
    - Validate that all required details (nf in lower-case, proper supi, and recognized uuid) are present.
    - Call the patch_provisioned_data_profile function with parameters: nf, supi, and uuid.

11. Retrieve UE Location Information:
    - Prompt: "Please provide the network function name (in lower-case, e.g., 'smf'), the user/device/UE identifier (must start with 'imsi-'), and the PDU Session ID (as a plain string, e.g., '1') for which you require location information."
    - Normalize the network function name to lower-case and validate that the supi starts with 'imsi-' and the PDU Session ID is properly formatted.
    - Call the get_supi_location function with parameters: nf, supi, and pdu_session_id.

12. Post-Action Clarification:
    - After executing the customer's requested action(s), ask: "Is there anything more I can assist you with regarding managing the HPE 5G Core?"
    - If the customer has additional requests, process them using the appropriate steps above. If not, proceed to Step 13.

13. Final Case Resolution:
    - Once the customer confirms no further assistance is needed, call the close_case function using an appropriate lower-case network function name (for example, 'udr').
    
Notes:
- Always normalize all network function name parameters (nf, target_nf) to lower-case before making any function call.
- Validate parameter types carefully: user identifiers must start with 'imsi-', data profile UUIDs must match the approved format, and the PDU Session ID should be provided as a plain string.
- For ambiguous or incomplete requests, request clarification from the customer before proceeding.
- The final action for every case must be to call close_case to close the case properly.
