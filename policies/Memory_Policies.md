# Memory Management Policy Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the policies and procedures for managing memory within our Gen AI platform. These policies are designed to ensure that data handled in memory is managed responsibly, securely, and transparently. The focus is on minimizing data retention, securing transient data, and adhering to ethical standards while maintaining the functionality and performance of the platform.

## Data Minimization

### Principle of Least Retention

#### Policy-1

- Memory should only retain data for the duration necessary to perform the intended operation.
- Ephemeral memory (e.g., session data, transient interactions) must be cleared immediately after use to prevent unnecessary data retention.

### Session Management

#### Policy-2

- User sessions should be managed to ensure that memory only holds data relevant to the ongoing session.
- At the end of a session, all session-related data must be purged from memory unless there is an explicit need for further processing.

## Memory Utilization in AI Systems

### Contextual Memory

#### Policy-3

- The AI system should retain context in memory only for the duration of the user interaction to provide relevant responses.
- Contextual memory must be cleared at the end of each session or interaction, unless it is essential for a continuous user experience.
