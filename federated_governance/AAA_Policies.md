# Authentication and Authorization Policy Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the policies and procedures governing Authentication and Authorization within our Gen AI platform. These policies are designed to ensure secure, responsible access to the platform's tools and features, aligned with Data Mesh Architecture principles and Responsible AI guidelines. Emphasizing Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), these measures ensure that user access is both secure and appropriately scoped to their roles and responsibilities.

## Authentication Guidelines

### Single Sign-On (SSO) Implementation

SSO is a critical component of our Authentication strategy, enabling users to access multiple tools and applications within the platform using a single set of credentials. This simplifies the login process while maintaining high security standards.

#### Policy-1

- All web applications and tools within the platform must support SSO authentication to streamline user access and enhance security.
- SSO mechanisms should comply with industry-standard protocols (e.g., OAuth, SAML) to ensure interoperability and security.
- The SSO system must be regularly audited to detect and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

## Authorization Guidelines

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is essential for managing user access within the platform, ensuring that users can only access tools and features appropriate to their roles. This control should be applied both at a coarse-grained level (tool access) and a fine-grained level (feature access within tools).

#### Policy-2: Coarse-Grained RBAC

- Access to each tool within the platform should be restricted based on the user's role, with roles defined according to the principle of least privilege.
- Users must only be granted access to the tools necessary for their specific responsibilities.
- Access roles should be reviewed regularly to ensure they align with current job functions and organizational needs.

#### Policy-3: Fine-Grained RBAC

- Within each tool, user access should be further refined to control which features or datasets a user can interact with.
- For example, in a RAG (Retriever-And-Generator) tool, a user may have access to certain documents but not others. The system must respect these restrictions when generating responses.
- Fine-grained permissions should be adjustable to accommodate changes in user roles or data sensitivity.

## Responsible AI Principles

### Transparency and Accountability

To support the principles of Responsible AI, our platform's Authentication and Authorization processes must be transparent and accountable.

#### Policy-4

- Users should be informed about what data is collected and how their access is managed within the platform.
- Any changes to a user's access privileges must be logged and made available for audit purposes.
- Users should have a mechanism to request access changes or report access issues, with these requests handled promptly and transparently.
