# üåê Mesh Orchestrator: Your Smart Integration Layer

## ü§ñ What Is the Mesh Orchestrator?

The **Mesh Orchestrator** is a smart assistant behind the scenes that connects your chat interface to powerful AI tools and reasoning engines. It works like a dispatcher that understands what you‚Äôre asking and finds the right tool to help.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. OpenAI-Compatible Chat API

- **Plug-and-Play Integration**: Use existing OpenAI-compatible tools without changing your chat interface.
- **Standard Endpoints**: Works through `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models`.

### 2. Smart Routing and Tool Usage

- **Understands Requests**: Breaks down and interprets your message to decide which tool or model to use.
- **Custom Workflows**: Uses project-specific logic to choose tools or knowledge bases automatically.

### 3. Reasoning Engine

- **Decision Making**: Acts like a brain ‚Äî it decides how to handle complex tasks and which steps to take.
- **Multi-step Thinking**: Can use multiple tools in a row to solve a problem.

### 4. Tool Mesh Integration

- **MCP Tool Support**: Connects to external agents (like search tools, calculators, or APIs) using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Streaming Support**: Some tools respond in real-time, updating you as they work.

## üìã How It Works

1. **You Send a Chat Request**: Just like chatting with GPT or another assistant.
2. **The Orchestrator Parses It**: It validates the message and extracts key information.
3. **It Finds the Right Tools**: The reasoning engine picks one or more tools based on what you need.
4. **You Get a Structured Answer**: The orchestrator collects the responses and formats them neatly.
