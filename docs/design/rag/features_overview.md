# üìö LAT-Mesh RAG Service: Smarter Answers from Your Own Data

## üîç What Is LAT-Mesh RAG Service?

The **LAT-Mesh RAG Service** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that enhances LLM responses by grounding them in your private documents. Instead of relying solely on model memory, it retrieves relevant context from trusted sources‚Äîensuring **accurate**, **explainable**, and **customized** answers.

It‚Äôs your intelligent research assistant for documentation-heavy environments like networking, security, compliance, and enterprise systems.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. **Document-Aware Q\&A**

* **Grounded Answers**: Responses are based on your technical documents, not just generic web data.
* **Explainable Context**: Each answer includes the source excerpts used to generate it.

### 2. **Smart Retrieval**

* **Semantic Search**: Uses vector similarity to find relevant information, even if your query isn‚Äôt an exact match.
* **Fast and Scalable**: Optimized for low-latency querying across large corpora.

### 3. **Query Augmentation**

* **HyDE Support**: Generates hypothetical documents to improve retrieval.
* **Prompt-Based Expansion**: Reformulates vague queries for better match accuracy.

### 4. **Flexible Reranking**

* **Optional Reranking**: Uses a cross-encoder model to improve precision.
* **Configurable Output**: Choose top N most relevant results.

### 5. **Concise Summarization**

* **LLM-Based Answering**: Summarizes relevant chunks into a human-readable response.
* **Template-Driven**: Uses consistent, customizable prompt structures for clarity.

## üß† How It Works

1. **You Ask a Question**: Send your query to the RAG service.
2. **\[Optional] Augmentation**: The system improves your query using LLM prompting.
3. **Retrieve from Docs**: Relevant text chunks are pulled from the vector database.
4. **\[Optional] Rerank**: The system scores and reorders the chunks for precision.
5. **Generate Answer**: The top chunks are summarized into a clear response.
6. **Review Sources**: You get both the answer *and* a JSON block showing which documents it came from.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Options

* **Enable/Disable Reranking**: Prioritize speed or precision.
* **Choose Augmentation Strategy**: Use `expansion`, `hyde`, or disable entirely.
* **Control Summary Length**: Adjust the number of document chunks used.
* **Plug in Your Own Models**: Swap in different vector stores or LLMs as needed.
