# Prompt Management Policy Document

## Introduction

This document establishes the policies and procedures for managing prompts within our Gen AI platform. Prompts are critical inputs that guide AI behavior and output. To ensure high-quality, safe, and effective AI responses, prompts must be handled with the same rigor as code, following the data-as-code principle, alongside adherence to Responsible AI principles.

## Data-as-Code Principle

### Policy-1: Treating Prompts as Code

- Prompts should be treated with the same level of scrutiny, version control, and documentation as code, ensuring they are consistently structured and aligned with system requirements.
- All prompts used in the system must be reviewed and tested before deployment to ensure they produce the desired outcomes and adhere to ethical guidelines.
- Any changes to prompt structures or content must undergo a formal change management process, including impact assessment and validation.

### Policy-2: Version Control and Auditing

- Prompts must be version-controlled, with each version documented to capture changes, reasoning, and intended outcomes.
- The system should maintain an audit trail of all prompts used, allowing for post-interaction review to understand how prompts influenced AI outputs.
- Auditing should include regular reviews to identify prompts that may no longer align with current standards or have been found to produce undesirable results.

## Responsible AI Principles

### Policy-3: Helpfulness and Relevance

- Prompts must be designed to generate responses that are helpful, relevant, and directly aligned with the user's query or intent.
- The system should avoid using prompts that could lead to ambiguous, misleading, or unhelpful responses.
- Regular testing should be conducted to ensure that prompts continue to elicit responses that are both useful and aligned with user needs.

### Policy-4: Ethical and Safe Operation

- Prompts must be crafted to avoid generating harmful, biased, or unethical content. This includes avoiding prompts that could lead to discriminatory or otherwise inappropriate responses.
- The system should include mechanisms to detect and flag prompts that might lead to such outcomes, with automatic modifications or rejections applied as needed.
- Any identified issues with prompts should be addressed immediately, with a thorough review to prevent similar issues in the future.
